Week 1: Implement the following: guess_number, mysum, and run_timing from "Python Workout"

Exercise: Write a function that accepts a list of integers and returns the product
i.e multiply_all([2, 3, 3]) -> 18

Homework: Write a function average() that prompts for integer inputs and returns their average. If "K" or "k" is entered, the function exits and returns average of all numbers entered.

## week 2

1. Pig Latin

In Ubbi Dubbi, every vowel (a, e, i, o, or u) is prefaced with ub.
Ask the user for a word, and return its Ubbi Dubbi form.

2. If the word begins with a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u), add “way” to the end of the
   word. So “air” becomes “airway” and “eat” becomes “eatway.”
   If the word begins with any other letter, then we take the first letter, put it on
   the end of the word, and then add “ay.” Thus, “python” becomes “ythonpay”
   and “computer” becomes “omputercay.”

examples:

- elephant -> ubelubephubant.
- octopus -> uboctubopubus
