# learn-python-2020

###Week 1:
Implement the following: guess_number, mysum, and run_timing from "Python Workout"

Exercise: Write a function that accepts a list of integers and returns the product
i.e multiply_all([2, 3, 3]) -> 18

Homework: Write a function average() that prompts for integer inputs and returns their average. If "K" or "k" is entered, the function exits and returns average of all numbers entered.

average()
please enter a number:
5
5
10
10
K
"average is 7.5"

### week 2

1. **Pig Latin**

- If the word begins with a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u), add “way” to the end of the
  word. So “air” becomes “airway” and “eat” becomes “eatway.”
- If the word begins with any other letter, then we take the first letter, put it on
  the end of the word, and then add “ay.” Thus, “python” becomes “ythonpay”
  and “computer” becomes “omputercay.”

2. In **Ubbi Dubbi**, every vowel (a, e, i, o, or u) is prefaced with ub.
   Ask the user for a word, and return its Ubbi Dubbi form.
   examples: - elephant -> ubelubephubant. - octopus -> uboctubopubus

3. **running average** Write a function get_average() that prompts the user to enter a sequence of space separated numbers. Return the average of that sequence.
   examples: get_average()
   1 2 3 4 5 6
   "average is 3.5"

### week 3

1. Write a function most_repeating(words) that takes in a list of words and returns the word with the most repeating letters. Assuming input strings are only lowercase.
   words = ['this', 'is', 'an', 'elementary', 'test', 'example']
   most_repeating(words) -> "elementary", e is repeated 3 times
